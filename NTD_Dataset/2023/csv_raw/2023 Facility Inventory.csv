Public Transit only occupies a very small part of the building and any repairs are not charged to the transit budget (see other reconciling items).  This was reported by them so perhaps we need to have more discussion about this.  Also note the building originally went into service as a public school in 1930.

We call it a transfer center because it is a raised platform (curb height) with a series of bus shelters and trash cans.  There is also a small building with office space for transit personnel and a lavatory for drivers.  We believe this qualifies as a transfer center.

LeeTran's Beach Park and Ride was classified as a Category 2 based on the significant damage to the facility and the roadways leading to the facility that resulted from Hurricane Ian on September 28, 2022, that caused the facility to close.  LeeTran re-evaluated the facility in October 2023 and reclassified it at a Category 3 based on the limited amenities (i.e. communications, pedestrian information system outages, etc.) and will continue to work towards meeting the standards of Category 4 which is the level of that station prior to the hurricane damage.

The condition assessment was downgraded to 3 after the June 2021 assessment during the COVID closures.  A feasibility study was done to determine what upgrades would need to be done in order to make our facility more ""pandemic friendly"".  We had to close our customer counter because of the inability to distance ourselves and customers from one another.  We also have very limited facilities for our drivers to prepare for their day, eat lunch, or sit and relax.  Our administrative offices are small and do not allow for any type of meeting without broaching the 6' distance.  The study has determined that changes need to be made in all of these areas.  With the addition of new buses this past year, there is a need for more room to park buses.  Some have to be left in the washbay and the service bay at night due to lack of parking.  There are many upgrades that could be done as well and we have a state capital grant to complete some of the work needed right away in the back."

There are 19 total that are located along the Prospect Max corridor, which ranges from 12th and Prospect Avenue to 75th and Prospect Avenue, a major BRT line.  

Only two of these stops  we believe are attributable to the NTD definition of Passenger Stations, despite a few attempts to nail down this definition.  The kiosks along this project are most dual sides and many have markers, power, and other amenities.

This entry is for the Passenger Station Transit Center at 12th and Charlotte (aka East Village Transit Center).  This center features a local post with real time video display; a double-sided free standing kiosk; a standing building; 8 double-sided exterior signs; 2 cradle point routers; along with other features.
