The average miles per year in the last 7 years is approximately 450 miles/year. Since this vehicle is used for larger jobs (crane) it is not utilized like a normal truck.  The cumulative condition rating  for 2022 was 2.07.  The rating does not decrease at the rate of other service vehicles.  Therefore, we are increasing the useful life of the service truck with crane to 23 years."
