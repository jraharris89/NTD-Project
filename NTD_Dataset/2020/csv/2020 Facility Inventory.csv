Public Transit only occupies a very small part of the building and any repairs are not charged to the transit budget (see other reconciling items).  This was reported by them so perhaps we need to have more discussion about this.  Also note the building originally went into service as a public school in 1930.

responding to the open issue within the A-15 form, SCAT has indicated no capital responsibility for the Venice Train Depot passenger station facility.  In RY 2018, Sarasota County, doing business as SCAT, did not report the Venice Train Depot transfer station as a facility.  We are reporting the facility in RY 2019 to comply with the NTD reporting manual requiring inventory of all facilities used in revenue service.  SCAT, as the FTA designated recipient, does not have responsibility for the Venice Train Depot because no FTA Federal funding has been used to build this facility.  This facility is owned by Sarasota County, and used by SCAT in its operation. 
Daniel's Response
SCAT is a county department and under the county, then you would have capital responsibility"

There are 19 total that are located along the Prospect Max corridor, which ranges from 12th and Prospect Avenue to 75th and Prospect Avenue, a major BRT line.  

Only two of these stops  we believe are attributable to the NTD definition of Passenger Stations, despite a few attempts to nail down this definition.  The kiosks along this project are most dual sides and many have markers, power, and other amenities.

This entry is for the Passenger Station Transit Center at 12th and Charlotte (aka East Village Transit Center).  This center features a local post with real time video display; a double-sided free standing kiosk; a standing building; 8 double-sided exterior signs; 2 cradle point routers; along with other features.
